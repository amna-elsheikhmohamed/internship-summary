        <h2>Week 1: Introduction & Orientation</h2>
        <h3>Sunday</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The week began with an official introduction to the team and the signing of the internship contract.</li>
            <li>Tour of the National Museum: I went on an immersive tour of the National Museum to familiarize myself with the exhibits, layout, and visitor engagement techniques currently in place.</li>
            <li>Completed 12 Visitor Engagement Sheets: I observed visitor interactions and completed 12 engagement observation sheets. This activity provided insights into how visitors respond to various exhibits, particularly multimedia ones, helping us understand their engagement levels and areas for improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Monday</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Engaged with visitors and gathered feedback through surveys. This survey aimed to understand their opinions on the museum‚Äôs multimedia.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tuesday & Wednesday</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I dedicated time to studying Power BI, a powerful tool for analyzing data. My focus was on creating an analysis of the multimedia survey data, which I called the ‚ÄúVisitor Survey Analysis.‚Äù Through tutorials and practice, I learned how to use Power BI's basic functionalities to visualize feedback data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Thursday</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I created a GitHub account and made a simple vlog to recap my week‚Äôs activities.</li>
            <li>Drafted a report using the results and insights from the Visitor Survey Analysis conducted in Power BI.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>From Power BI: I learned how to clean and sort the data, unpivot columns, and create engaging visualizations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially unsure if I cleaned the data correctly, but I checked with Tooba for confirmation.</li>
            <li>Some aspects of the data were challenging to visualize effectively, particularly complex visitor feedback in textual form.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôve always been eager to learn more about Power BI, so it was great to work with real data during my internship. I hope to take a course to further enhance my knowledge of it. I‚Äôve visited the museum twice before, but this time feels different because I‚Äôm focused on learning about the technologies available at the museum, rather than just the historical aspects.</p>
