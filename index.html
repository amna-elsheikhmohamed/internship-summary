    <h3><strong>Introduction & Orientation: My Internship Journey at Qatar Museums</strong></h3>
<h3>Sunday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The week began with an official introduction to the team and the signing of the internship contract.</li>
  <li>Tour of the National Museum: I went on an immersive tour of the National Museum to familiarize myself with the exhibits, layout, and visitor engagement techniques currently in place.</li>
  <li>Completing 12 Visitor Engagement Sheets: I observed visitor interactions and completed 12 engagement observation sheets. This activity provided insights into how visitors respond to various exhibits, particularly multimedia ones, helping us understand their engagement levels and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Engaging with visitors and gathering feedback through surveys. This survey aimed to understand their opinions on the museum’s multimedia.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tuesday & Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I dedicated time to studying Power BI, a powerful tool for analyzing data. My focus was on creating an analysis of the multimedia survey data, which I called the “Visitor Survey Analysis.” Through tutorials and practice, I learned how to use Power BI's basic functionalities to visualize feedback data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I created a GitHub account and made a simple vlog to recap my week’s activities.</li>
  <li>I drafted a report using the results and insights from the Visitor Survey Analysis conducted in Power BI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>From Power BI:
    <ul>
      <li>I learned how to clean and sort the data.</li>
      <li>I learned how to unpivot columns.</li>
      <li>I learned about silence visualization; it really cool and makes the graphics more interactive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initially unsure if I cleaned the data correctly, but I checked with Tooba for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Some aspects of the data were challenging to visualize effectively. For example, complex visitor feedback, especially in textual responses, made it difficult to present insights clearly and concisely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have always been eager to learn more about Power BI, so it was great to work with real data during my internship. I hope to take a course to further enhance my knowledge of it. I’ve visited the museum twice before, but this time feels different because I’m focused on learning about the technologies available at the museum, rather than just the historical aspects.</p>

    <h3><strong>Project Overview: Fictional Museum Audio Guide</strong></h3>

    <p>
        This project is an interactive audio guide for a fictional exhibition, allowing users to explore multimedia content through a customized website. The guide includes audio in multiple languages generated using a text-to-speech tool, offering an immersive experience for museum visitors.
    </p>

    <h2>Software Tools</h2>
    <div class="tools">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ruby & Jekyll:</strong> Framework used to create the website.</li>
            <li><strong>YAML:</strong> Used for configuration and data management.</li>
            <li><strong>Eleven Labs:</strong> Text-to-speech tool used to generate audio files in different languages (Arabic, English, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        The project involves forking the Australian Center for Moving Image’s source code, customized with specific designs and multimedia elements. Audio in various languages is created using Eleven Labs or other text-to-speech tools. The website’s design is modified to suit the fictional exhibition’s theme, and the multimedia content from Qatar Museum's exhibitions is incorporated into the guide. The audio files are integrated into the website, providing an interactive audio tour experience for users.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning Ruby, a framework I am unfamiliar with, and finding it challenging to stay motivated due to its age and complexity.</li>
        <li>Understanding and applying YAML effectively to structure data for the website.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Project Overview:Exploring Getty's Quire Platform & Museum Exhibition Visit</strong></h3>

<p>This week, I’m looking into a new platform, Getty’s Quire, to explore its capabilities in publishing an exhibition catalogue. My task involves forking existing code to create a custom publication, testing out its features, and experimenting with different formats: a downloadable PDF, an e-book, and an online version, and check if it supports the Arabic language.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Achievements</h2>
<p>I tried to install Quire and Node on my laptop, but it didn’t work. I asked Tooba for help, but it didn’t work on her laptop either. I think there might be an issue with the platform, so I emailed their support team. They sent me some solutions, and I’ll try them later and update you.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc40ab7a-9af7-4c92-b3f9-4df44eac4808" alt="Processed Image" height="200" width="auto"></p>

<h3>Thursday</h3>
<p>Today, our team visited the Arab Museum of Modern Art to explore the exhibition *Seeing Is Believing: The Art and Influence of Gérôme*. We aimed to experience it from a guest’s perspective and to check the audio guide available there.</p>

<p>It was an amazing and entirely new experience for me—my first time learning about Orientalism in art. I was captivated by Gérôme’s realistic style; he portrayed Arab life with authenticity, capturing the essence of that time period without imposing European perspectives. His art is rich in detail and color, truly bringing history to life. I was also amazed at how well-preserved the paintings were. Despite being over 200 years old, they looked almost new, as if they had just been painted.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1be9e9ee-a138-4017-ba07-bb5355f1f3d4" alt="Processed Image" height="200" width="auto"></p>

<p>The first two sections of the exhibition were the most intriguing for me, especially the multimedia displays, which revealed details I hadn’t noticed before. For instance, in one of Gérôme's paintings depicting prayer, he showed people in different postures. This caught my attention because, in Islam, we pray in unison, moving through the same stages together. The multimedia explanation helped me realize that Gérôme likely intended to capture all the stages of prayer within a single scene.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45b25b98-5156-4ff5-9a36-14b76e0e9bd5" alt="Processed Image" height="200" width="auto"></p>

<p>The audio guide added an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience, offering a brief yet captivating story behind each painting. It wasn’t just informative; it brought the artwork to life in a way that felt personal and engaging. With its distinctive and clear voice, the audio guide truly enhanced the exhibition, making the experience even more immersive.</p>

            <h3><strong>Project Overview: Analyzing MoMA Collection Using Power BI</strong></h3>

<p>My task this week is to explore different museum online collections and choose a collection to analyze using Power BI. I chose The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection, which contains a dataset of artists and artworks. I've attempted to visualize it.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One challenge I faced was trying to use a line chart or Gantt chart to visualize the birth and death dates, as well as the age of the artist, but it didn’t work for me. So, I ended up using a table instead. I think it would be cooler if it were a chart.</li>
</ul>
